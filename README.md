# JH-Web-Developers
## Johns Hopkins University - HTML, CSS, JavaScript for Web Developers

In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We will start from the ground up by 
learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such 
that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able 
to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! 
Last but certainly not least, we will get a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful 
language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, you will be able to build a fully functional web application that 
utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.

## Week 1

### Introduction to CSS3
A lot of people "tinker" with CSS. In this module, we'll take you from the very basics of CSS3 to some fairly advanced 
concepts like floating and CSS rule conflict resolution. We'll go over the 'box model', background property, etc. 
We'll finish off the module with learning about Responsive Design using our own CSS code as well as start introducing 
Twitter Bootstrap with its essential Grid System.

## Week 3
### Coding the Static Restaurant Site
Ready for some REAL fun? This module is it! We'll go over some basics of interacting with a client when managing 
a web site project and then go visit a real client at their place of business (a Chinese restaurant), help the 
owner figure out what she wants in a site, and get acquainted with the restaurant in general. We'll spend the 
rest of the module building a real web site for this business from scratch and you'll get to sit next to me 
and watch as the site comes together.

## Week 4
### Introduction to Javascript
What fun would a web site be if there was no functionality to it? In this module, we are going to concentrate 
on learning the fundamentals of the Javascript language. A lot of even seasoned developers “tinker” with 
Javascript without really understanding how the language works. That leads to viewing the language as 
more of a nuisance instead of a powerful tool. That is why we are going to concentrate not only on the 
“how” but also on the “why”, so you are empowered by the Javascript language features, not confused by 
them. We’ll cover just about everything - from common language constructs and Javascript types to 
objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation.

## Week 5
### Using Javascript to Build Web Applications
In this module, we are going to take all those newly learned Javascript language skills and learn how to 
utilize them within the context of a web page. We’ll start by learning how to properly manipulate the 
web page components using the Javascript Document Object Model API. We will then move on to learning 
one of the most popular ways of serving up data to a web site - Ajax. We'll learn about the protocol 
that the language of the web speaks in (HTTP), how to set up and handle Ajax requests and responses, 
as well as how to process JSON data. We'll finish the module by connecting our restaurant web site 
from Module 3 to a real backend service that will allow us to pull the data for the restaurant menu 
dynamically from the server without having to reload the entire page.
