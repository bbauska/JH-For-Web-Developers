# Week 5 - Using JavaScript to Build Web Applications

In this module, we are going to take all those newly learned Javascript language skills and learn how to 
utilize them within the context of a web page. Weâ€™ll start by learning how to properly manipulate the web 
page components using the Javascript Document Object Model API. We will then move on to learning one of 
the most popular ways of serving up data to a web site - Ajax. We'll learn about the protocol that the 
language of the web speaks in (HTTP), how to set up and handle Ajax requests and responses, as well as 
how to process JSON data. We'll finish the module by connecting our restaurant web site from Module 3 to 
a real backend service that will allow us to pull the data for the restaurant menu dynamically from the 
server without having to reload the entire page.
