# Week 02 - Introduction to CSS3

A lot of people "tinker" with CSS. In this module, we'll take you from the very basics of CSS3 to some 
fairly advanced concepts like floating and CSS rule conflict resolution. We'll go over the 'box model', 
background property, etc. We'll finish off the module with learning about Responsive Design using our 
own CSS code as well as start introducing Twitter Bootstrap with its essential Grid System.
