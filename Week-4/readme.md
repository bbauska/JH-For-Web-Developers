# Week 4- Introduction to JavaScript

What fun would a web site be if there was no functionality to it? In this module, we are going to concentrate on 
learning the fundamentals of the Javascript language. A lot of even seasoned developers “tinker” with Javascript 
without really understanding how the language works. That leads to viewing the language as more of a nuisance 
instead of a powerful tool. That is why we are going to concentrate not only on the “how” but also on the “why”, 
so you are empowered by the Javascript language features, not confused by them. We’ll cover just about everything 
from common language constructs and Javascript types to objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation.
