# Week 3
## Coding the Static Restaurant Site
Ready for some REAL fun? This module is it! We'll go over some basics of interacting with a client when managing 
a web site project and then go visit a real client at their place of business (a Chinese restaurant), help the 
owner figure out what she wants in a site, and get acquainted with the restaurant in general. We'll spend the 
rest of the module building a real web site for this business from scratch and you'll get to sit next to me and 
watch as the site comes together.
